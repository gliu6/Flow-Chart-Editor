# Flow-Chart-Editor
A flow chart editor designed and implemented through C++ MFC

This is an old project during my third year of undergraduate.
A flow chart editor is designed for users to draw and adjust flow-chart for programs.
The flow chart is adjustable. Flow chart can also be saved in image (png, jpeg) or in a project format.

Currently, there is a project report and test report in Chinese version, if you cannot read, bear with it!!!

Runnable applications are available as well, so test them out and use it in your daily life, celebrate!!!!
